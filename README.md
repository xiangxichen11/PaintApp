# Xiang Xi's CPSC 210 Personal Project

## Online Sketching Tool

**What will the application do?**  

For this application, I will be creating an online sketch pad with feature that are similar to microsoft paint. This
application should allow users to draw and write whatever they desire on a blank canvas. There will be a 
selection of tools in a toolbar for users to choose from such as a pencil, an eraser, different colors and potentially 
even shapes and clipart. 

**Who will use it?**

Overall, this program will act as place to draw and scribble whatever the user desires. This program will be available
to all audiences and there is no constraint to who can use it. I believe that anyone who needs a place to write 
something down or just draw whatever they want will have the ability to use this application.

**Why is this project of interest to you?**

I decided to create this project myself because I see myself using it a lot. Often times I just need a quick place to 
jot down a note or create a diagram for myself during my studies, but I do not want to take out some paper and write
it by hand. I believe that having an application like this at one's disposal allows for an easier time when working and 
studying.
